// Write a JavaScript program to calculate the factorial of a given number. 
// By asking this question, managers aim to assess the candidateâ€™s algorithmic thinking and understanding of JavaScript programming. 
//The interviewer expects the candidate to demonstrate their knowledge of the factorial concept. 
// Sample answer: A factorial number is the product of all positive integers, which are equal to or less than the given number.
